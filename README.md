# Water Usage Calculator Website

This was a project built for the Not University Hacks Hackathon. This website allows users to discover their approximate water usage by taking a water usage quiz. The front-end was built using Bootstrap. This website also gathers user emails and sends out an initial email with some water usage tips. This was handled by Twilio Sendgrid. The backend of this website was built with Flask.
