          <h3>Welcome to the Water Calculator!</h3>
          <p>
            This website allows users to calculate their water usage and compare it
            to location based data to find out if their water usage conflicts with their state's current drought protocols. The goal is to bring awareness to current water issues.
          </p>
          <h3>Why does this Exist?</h3>
          <p>
           With sudden weather events such as thunderstorms and hurricanes, it is a somewhat simple task to identify the causes and effects of these natural occurrences. Alternatively, the initial effects of a drought are significantly more difficult to identify right away, so it may take months in order to determine that a drought has started. Because of this, a drought may last for years or decades in a particular region. Because of the unexpected nature of droughts, the difficulties associated with a lack of clean drinking water become amplified over the course of the drought. This can severely impact agricultural industries, wildlife, and ecosystems. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the waterblot team is dedicated to instructing users on their current water usage in tandem with their stateâ€™s drought warnings. This serves as a basis to understand how much water is being excessively wasted during dire times.
